Initial setup 


1) Create the posting bot 

	1. Login ACP, GENERAL - QUICK ACCESS -> Spiders/Robots page, click Add bot. 

	2. Input "RSS Express [RSS Bot]" as the Bot name, for example. Please make sure the input  
	contains the string "[RSS Bot]", this is the keyword to identify posting bot in this mod.         

		Instructions for changing this keyword: 

			Edit includes/constants.php 

			FIND 
				define('FIND_BOT_ID', '[RSS Bot]');        // string to identify our posting bot 
			REPLACED WITH 
				define('FIND_BOT_ID', '{My Bot ID}');        // string to identify our posting bot 

		Note: Replace {My Bot ID} with text of your choice 

	3. Select the Bot language, which is 'British English' if your phpBB3 site doesn't have other
	languages installed. Bot language is used as posting language for the imported feed. 

	4. If you don't know what to do, leave 'Agent match' blank for now. You can update this later. 

	5. If you like to see this bot user in "Who is online" from the index page, Input "your server IP" 
	for Bot IP address. If you don't, input "127.0.0.1". DON'T leave this blank! 


2) Manage feed from GENERAL - BOARD CONFIGURATION -> RSS Import Settings.

	Click 'Add Feed' to proceed

	For example, add this mod's topic RSS from pbpbb.com:

		Feed Name <- RSS Input - Development
		Feed URL  <- http://www.phpbb.com/community/feed.php?f=70&t=1858455

		Select Post Forum/Bot from drop down list
		Leave other fileds untouched

	Click 'Submit' to update feed list.

	Note: Validate source before proceeding to next step.


3) Verify mod installation

	1. Click the check box to select feed
	2. Select 'Import now' from the drop down list
	3. Click 'Submit' to manual import selected feed(s)

	Note: If the mod installation is good, the 'Information' page will show a line with
	"Feed(s) with error: None." shortly after the mouse click.


4) Secure rss_import.php 
 
	Q. Why you need to secure rss_import.php? 
	A. Since rss_import.php generate some server loads and resides in your phpBB root, which is  
	accessible by anyone, there are risks of DOS attack to your site(or DOS attack on the RSS source 
	sites through rss_import.php). 

	The default is to allow feed import by external program from your server IP.  

	1. Default is for dedicated web servers with own IP. Possible DOS attack handled by phpbb core. 
	The recommendation is to do 2 and 3 below. 

	2. Set 'USER_AGENT' with the ID of external program which calls rss_import.php in your crontab. 

	Example crontab entry: 

		# Your phpbb site: automatic RSS feeds import, hourly update at xx30 
		30  */1 * * *   curl -Ss http://www.example.com/rss_import.php?feed=1,2,3 

	From example above, your external program is 'curl' and the User Agent contains the string  
	"curl". You have to figured out the User Agent string from apache access log if you use other   
	programs. 

		Edit rss_import.php: 

		FIND 
			define('USER_AGENT', '');        // e.g. set 'lwp-request' for perl GET, 'curl' for curl. 
		REPLACED WITH 
			define('USER_AGENT', 'curl'); 

	This prevents running RSS Import code other than calling from the web server IP with external 
	program which user-agent contains "curl". This will be sufficient for attacks outside your server. 

	3. If your web server's IP is shared with other sites, rename rss_import.php to what others can't
	guess easily. For example, _somethingelse_.php. Changing the filename can prevents possible DOS
	attack from any IPs. Remember to update your CRON job entries for the filename changes. 


5) Verify the initial setup 

	1. If the setting is good, the imported articles will be in the posting forum after timeout. 
	2. If something wrong with the settings or no post imported, the cron job owner will get an
	  automatic email with error messages for source related issues. 
	3. If no post imported and no email sent, login to server terminal and try command line import. 
		e.g. curl http://www.example.com/rss_import.php?feed=1 

	If you don't have terminal access or got error message from the command line with keyword 
	'deny' or 'security', ask your server admin for support. 

	Note: rss_import.php designed for automatic feed import with scheduler (e.g. CRON for Linux). 
	Null page will be returned on success, plain text on error. 


6)	Optional - enable "unauthorized" message ( *Not Recommended* )

	If you want to show "unauthorized access" message:

		Edit rss_import.php: 

		FIND 
			define('HACK_MSG', false); 
		REPLACED WITH 
			define('HACK_MSG', true); 

	You may also like to change the message contents as well:

		Edit language/{en}/find.php: 

		FIND 
			'HACK_ATTEMPT'        => 'Suspected hack attempts detected.' . "\n", 
		REPLACED WITH 
			'HACK_ATTEMPT'        => '{your message}' . "\n", 

	Note: If you mess up with language file, your phpBB will cease functioning!
