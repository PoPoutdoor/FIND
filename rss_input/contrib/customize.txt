Customize v1.1.0


A. Change posting bot keyword

		Edit includes/constants.php 

		FIND 
			define('FIND_BOT_ID', '[FIND Bot]');        // string to identify our posting bot 
		REPLACED WITH 
			define('FIND_BOT_ID', '{My Bot ID}');        // string to identify our posting bot 

	Note: Replace {My Bot ID} with text of your choice and create/edit posting bot


B. Change appearance of imported post

	The layout of imported post can be customized by altering language file
	language/{lang}/find_posting.php.

	If you create custom BBCode for Horizontal line (HR) and Tab (TAB), update related entries with
	your BBCode will do the trick.

	Note: If you mess up with language file, your phpBB will cease functioning!


C. Add topic icon

	To enable topic icon, first enable topic icon for the posting forum(s), then edit includes/constants.php

		FIND
			//	FIND

		ADD AFTER
			define('FIND_ICON', 6);   // this is the find post icon_id

	Note: Checkup the id number from ACP, then change '6' with the icon ID of your choice.


D. Add custom filters

	You can set custom filter for each feed from ACP now!

	Note: To use html filter, enable ACP feed html setting first!


E. Change "Read More" text link to link (Source: [url]http://the_source/link[/url]) only.


	Edit language/en/find_posting.php

		FIND
			'BB_READ_MORE'   => "\n" . '[url=%s][i]Read more...[/i][/url]' . "\n\n",

		REPLACED WITH
			'BB_READ_MORE'   => "\n" . 'Source: [url]%s[/url]' . "\n\n",


F. Additional Atom feed support

	Namespace support been added, starting from this version. Check the limited media:thumbnail code under 
	'//--- namespace support ---//' from includes/functions_find.php
