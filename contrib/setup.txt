Initial setup for v1.1.0(BD3)


1) Create the posting bot 

	1. Login ACP, GENERAL - QUICK ACCESS -> Spiders/Robots page, click Add bot. 

	2. Input "News Express [FIND Bot]" as the Bot name, for example. Please make sure the input  
	contains the string "[FIND Bot]", this is the keyword to identify posting bot in this mod.         

	3. Select the Bot language, which is 'British English' if your phpBB3 site doesn't have other
	languages installed. Bot language is used as posting language for the imported feed. 

	4. If you don't know what to do, leave 'Agent match' blank for now. You can update this later. 

	5. If you like to display bot user in "Who is online" from the index page, Input "your server IP" 
	for Bot IP address. If you don't, input "127.0.0.1". DON'T leave this blank! 


2) Manage feed from GENERAL - BOARD CONFIGURATION -> FIND Settings.

	Click 'Add Feed' to proceed: 

	For example, add this mod's topic RSS from pbpbb.com:

		Feed Name <- FIND - Development
		Feed URL  <- http://www.phpbb.com/community/feed.php?t=1858455

	Click 'Submit' to vildate feed and auto config feed properties.

		Select Post Forum/Bot from drop down list after page refreshed
		Leave other fileds untouched

	Click 'Submit' to update feed entry.


3) Verify mod installation

	Click 'Import' from feed list, or:

		1. Click check box to select feed
		2. Select 'Import now' from the drop down list
		3. Click 'Submit'

	to manual import selected feed(s)

	Note: If the mod installation is good, the 'Information' page will show a line with
	"Feed(s) with error: None." shortly after the mouse click.


4) Verify the initial setup 

	1. If the setting is good, the imported articles will be in the posting forum after CRON timeout. 
	2. If something wrong with the settings or no post imported, the cron job owner will get an
	automatic email with error messages for source related issues. 
	3. If no post imported and no email sent, login to server terminal and try command line import. 

		e.g. curl http://www.example.com/feed_import.php?feed=1 

	If you don't have terminal access or got error message from the command line with keyword 
	like 'block', 'deny' or 'security', ask your server admin for support. 

	Note: feed_import.php designed for working with scheduler (e.g. CRON for Linux). Null page will be 
	returned on success, plain text on error. 


5) Secure feed_import.php 

	Q. Why you need to secure feed_import.php? 

	A. Since feed_import.php resides in your phpBB root(accessible	by anyone), which generate additional
	server loads when access. Default is to allow feed import by any external program for initial installation
	test. 

	**If you allows unauthorized feed import, your site is opened for DoS attack (also the feed source site)** .


	1. Set 'FIND_USER_AGENT' with the ID of external program which calls feed_import.php in your crontab. 

	From example above, your external program is 'curl' and the User Agent contains the string  
	"curl". You have to figured out the User Agent string from the access log if you use other   
	external programs. 

	This prevents running code other than calling external program which user-agent contains "curl".
	BUT this is NOT sufficient to protect your site!
	
	External program which supports custom User-Agent value is *recommended*. You can set this to 
	encrypted string to prevent unauthorized feed import, thus avoid DoS attempt through this mod.
	
		Example for generating encrypted string:
		
			Logon to console, type 'openssl passwd' then type *some text without space*
			after re-type text just entered, encrypted string will be display.

		Edit includes/constants.php: 

			FIND 
				//define('FIND_USER_AGENT', '');
			REPLACED WITH 
				define('FIND_USER_AGENT', '*secret*'); 

		Example crontab entry: 

			# Your phpbb site: automatic feed import, hourly update at xx30 
			30  */1 * * *   curl -sA '*secret*' http://www.example.com/feed_import.php?feed=1,2,3 
			
		Note: Update posting bot's 'Agent match' setting when you're done.

	*Test user agent setting
	
		Enable unauthorized feed import message

			Edit feed_import.php: 

			FIND 
				define('HACK_MSG', false); 
			REPLACED WITH 
				define('HACK_MSG', true); 

		Login to console or wait for cron feed import timeout, no console message or email indicated
		the setting is good. Then disable unauthorized feed import message for normal operation

			Edit feed_import.php: 

			FIND 
				define('HACK_MSG', false); 
			REPLACED WITH 
				define('HACK_MSG', true); 

	2. Rename feed_import.php
	
	Changing the filename further prevent chances of DoS.

		Example console command:
		
			~ # mv feed_import.php _somethingelse_.php
	
		*Update your CRON job entries for the filename changes. 
	
	3. Move feed_import.php
	
	To further secure feed_import.php, you can put the renamed file into dedicated URL.

		Example crontab entry: 

			# Your phpbb site: automatic feed import, hourly update at xx30 
			30  */1 * * *   curl -sA '*secret*' http://www.example.com/_hard_to_guess_/_renamed_.php?feed=1,2,3 
		
	4. Add server-side access control
	
	You can do much more on server-side to prevent unauthorized feed import, like IP access restrictions
	or enforce access rate limiting. Please consult your web server manual for details.
	
	You may also need support from your hosting to do the tricks.

	Note: Applied all above is the best way to prevent unauthorized feed import. Applied method #1 for the least
	security measure: DON'T leave FIND_USER_AGENT undefined!
